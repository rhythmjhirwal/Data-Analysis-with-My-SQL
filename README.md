# 📊 Employee Management & Payroll System — SQL Portfolio Project

A complete SQL-based employee database and payroll management system simulating real-world HR and finance use cases. This project demonstrates end-to-end data modeling, query writing, and business analysis using SQL.

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The project uses mock-generated data across four relational tables:

- **`employees.csv`** – Employee details (ID, name, age, gender, department, salary, join date)  
- **`departments.csv`** – Department ID and department name  
- **`attendance.csv`** – Daily attendance status (Present/Absent/Leave)  
- **`payroll.csv`** – Monthly payroll breakdown (basic pay, deductions, net pay)

> Each file contains approximately 300 rows of realistic data.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Analyze workforce distribution by department  
- Identify top-paid employees  
- Summarize monthly payroll trends  
- Evaluate attendance behavior  
- Detect high deduction anomalies  
- Explore recent joiners and department-level salary insights  

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **MySQL** — Schema creation, data insertion, foreign key constraints  
- **SQL** — Joins, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, subqueries, aggregation  
- **CSV** — Prepared and imported as mock data using spreadsheet tools
